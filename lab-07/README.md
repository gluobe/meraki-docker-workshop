# Lab 07 - Exercise

The goal of this lab is to combine everything that you have learned in the
previous labs and put it into practice.

Your goal is to create your own Docker image that contains a "Hello world!"
application in a JAVA.

Once you have created it, push it to the Docker Hub and  share it over Slack so
you colleagues can check what you have created.

Some pointers/requirements:
* use multi-stage image builds
* focus on minimal image size
* version your images (tags!)
