# Lab 06 - Docker on local machine

Now that you completed the Docker workshop in the cloud we are going to install
Docker locally. This is probably the usecase for most of the developers.

Docker locally is used to test an environment or test multiple versions of tools.
It's easy to get different environments with different versions of tools with
Docker.

## Task 1: Install Docker
Installing Docker Desktop is a very easy and straight forward process, simply
download the installer from this [link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and run it (to access the download
you will need a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account, see
[Lab 00](../lab-00/) for details on how to create a free Docker Hub account):

## Task 2:

Repeat [lab-05](../lab-05) and [lab-06](../lab-06) on your local machine.
